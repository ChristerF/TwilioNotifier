<div>
	This is a specific (possibly different) message sent only to the
	"culprits" who did the check-in causing a build failure. You can use
	the following variables.
	<ul>
		<li>%PROJECT% - references the name of the current project</li>
		<li>%STATUS% - the current status of the project
		<li>%CULPRITS% - lists the display names of the users who did the
			check-ins associated with the current build.</li>
		<li>%CULPRIT-NAME% - the display name of the culprit that the
			current message is being sent to.</li>
	</ul>
	<div>
		Example:
		<div>Hey %CULPRIT-NAME% you just broke the build for the project
			%PROJECT%.</div>
	</div>
